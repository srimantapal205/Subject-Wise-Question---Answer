# Experience-Based Managerial / Scenario Questions
---

### **1. Describe a situation where you led a team through a failed pipeline deployment. How did you handle it?**

**Example Answer:**
In one project, we deployed a new data pipeline that processed streaming IoT sensor data into a Delta Lake for near real-time reporting. The deployment failed due to schema evolution issues — unexpected nested fields in incoming JSON caused Spark jobs to break.

**How I handled it:**

* **Initial Response:** I took accountability and gathered the team for a rapid RCA (root cause analysis).
* **Containment:** Rolled back to the last stable version of the pipeline to minimize impact.
* **Communication:** Informed stakeholders about the issue, impact, and ETA for the fix.
* **Solution:** Implemented schema validation and evolution handling with structured streaming options (`mergeSchema`, `rescued data column`), and introduced a staging zone for new data types.
* **Retrospective:** We conducted a post-mortem and added a pre-deployment data profiling step in CI/CD pipelines.

### **2. How do you balance technical debt with delivery timelines in an agile data engineering project?**

**Approach:**

* **Track and Quantify Debt:** Maintain a tech debt register in Jira with impact and effort estimates.
* **Sprint Planning:** Allocate 10–20% of each sprint to debt-related tasks like refactoring or test coverage.
* **ROI Focus:** Prioritize technical debt items that have measurable impact on performance, scalability, or team productivity.
* **Stakeholder Education:** I communicate with product owners about the long-term cost of ignoring debt (e.g., increased bug rate, slower onboarding).
* **Example:** We delayed implementing a complex DAG orchestrator feature to first address Spark job failures due to poor error handling, which improved team velocity in the long run.

### **3. Have you ever disagreed with a stakeholder about a data design or approach? How did you resolve it?**

**Example:**
A stakeholder wanted to denormalize all customer transaction data into a single wide table in Azure SQL for simplicity, but I recommended a dimensional model in Synapse Analytics for scalability and performance.

**How I resolved it:**

* **Data-Driven Argument:** Presented benchmark results showing query performance degradation with the wide table approach.
* **Hybrid Solution:** Proposed materialized views for the most accessed use cases, while keeping the data model normalized underneath.
* **Collaborative Communication:** Framed my concerns in terms of their goals (faster insights, less maintenance), not just architecture preferences.
* **Result:** Stakeholder agreed to the model after seeing reduced query time and improved maintainability.

### **4. How do you mentor junior engineers in PySpark and big data development?**

**Techniques:**

* **Structured Onboarding:** I create a learning path (e.g., RDDs → DataFrames → UDFs → Performance Tuning).
* **Pair Programming:** Use real backlog tickets to walk them through tasks.
* **Code Reviews:** Focus on Spark best practices, explain why we avoid wide transformations or improper joins.
* **Knowledge Sharing:** Weekly office hours and internal tech talks on serialization, shuffling, partitioning, etc.
* **Empowerment:** I let them lead small POCs and guide them through architecture decisions.
* **Tooling:** Encourage use of Git, notebooks, and monitoring dashboards for observability.

### **5. Describe a time when you had to prioritize multiple data tasks under pressure. What criteria did you use?**

**Example:**
During a major product launch, we had to onboard a new data source, fix a data quality issue in a core KPI, and support a model deployment.

**Criteria I used:**

1. **Business Impact:** KPI bug affected exec dashboards — highest priority.
2. **Dependencies:** The ML model depended on cleaned data — second.
3. **Effort vs. ROI:** Onboarding new data was low urgency and high effort — postponed.
4. **Team Availability:** Assigned tasks based on strengths — junior engineers handled monitoring and data profiling.

**Outcome:** The prioritization ensured the launch went smoothly without data integrity issues.

### **6. How do you ensure data quality and governance in a complex data lake environment?**

**Approach:**

* **Data Contracts:** Define and enforce schema, types, and constraints at ingestion using ADF or Databricks Autoloader.
* **Validation Framework:** Build reusable PySpark data quality rules (e.g., null checks, referential integrity).
* **Layered Architecture:** Raw → Cleaned → Curated layers, with access control and lineage tracking (via Unity Catalog or Purview).
* **Observability:** Use tools like Great Expectations, Monte Carlo, or custom Spark logs for anomaly detection.
* **Audit Trail:** Store metadata and validation results in a control table, integrated with alerting tools.
* **Governance:** Use Purview or Unity Catalog for data discovery, classification, and access policy enforcement.

### **7. What KPIs do you track to evaluate the success of a Spark-based data pipeline?**

**Key KPIs:**

* **Latency:** Time from data ingestion to availability (e.g., <5 mins for streaming, <30 mins for batch).
* **Data Quality:** % of valid records, number of data quality rule violations.
* **Throughput:** Volume of data processed per run (e.g., GB/hr).
* **Job Success Rate:** % of successful runs over total scheduled runs.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Cost per GB processed, especially when using autoscaling clusters.
* **Scalability:** Performance consistency as data volume increases.
* **User Impact:** BI/dashboard freshness, user complaints, and SLA compliance.
* **Alert Metrics:** Number of critical alerts raised and resolved.
