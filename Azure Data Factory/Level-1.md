### Question 1: What is Azure Data Factory and why do you need it?
**Answer :** Azure Data Factory is a cloud-based service that enables data orchestration and integration. It acts as a conductor, managing various data activities to solve business problems. 

Common use cases include: 
1. Data Migration: Moving data between sources using activities like the Copy Activity. 
2. On-Premises to Cloud Data Transfer: 

For example, transferring data from an on-premises SQL Server to Azure SQL Cloud incrementally or on a schedule. 

3. ETL Operations: Extracting, transforming, and loading data, even unstructured or semi-structured data, using features like Data Flow.

### Question 2: What is a pipeline in Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :** A pipeline in Azure Data Factory is a collection of activities designed to execute in a defined sequence to achieve a specific task. It is the fundamental building block in ADF. For example:
- A pipeline may start with a Lookup Activity, followed by a Copy Activity.
- It can be used to define conditional logic, like "if condition A, do X; if condition B, do Y."

A basic pipeline could include just a single activity, such as moving data from an on-premises server to the cloud.

### Question 3: What do you mean by a data source in Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :** A data source in Azure Data Factory represents the input or output system involved in data movement or transformation processes. It can be:

- Source System: Where data is read from.
- Destination System: Where data is written to.

**Key Points about Data Sources:**

- Data sources are integral to ADF operations like reading, writing, or transforming data.
- Examples include SQL Server, Azure Blob Storage, Snowflake, MySQL, Postgres, etc.
- Supported data formats include text, binary, JSON, CSV, and even multimedia formats like audio, video, or images.
- ADF supports around 80â€“100 connectors for various data sources and destinations.

In essence, a data source is a system or storage used to interact with data during ADF operations.

### Question 4: What is a linked service in Azure Data Factory?

**Answer:** A linked service in Azure Data Factory is a connection object that defines how ADF connects to external data sources or systems.

**Key Points about Linked Services:**

- Acts as a bridge to connect external systems like Azure Blob Storage, SQL databases, or other supported services.
- Similar to a connection string in programming, it contains the necessary authentication details like server name, address, port, username, and password.
- Required whenever ADF interacts with systems outside its environment.

**Example: When moving data from an SQL database to Azure Blob Storage:**

- A linked service is created for the SQL database (source).
- Another linked service is created for Azure Blob Storage (destination).

### Question 5: What is a dataset in Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :** A dataset in Azure Data Factory represents a structure or pointer to the data within a data source. It acts as a reference to the actual data being used in pipelines.
Key Points about Datasets:
- Datasets define the data's schema and structure within a linked service.
- They vary depending on the data source (e.g., SQL database, Blob Storage, CSV file, binary file).
- A linked service is required to create a dataset, as it provides the connection to the data source.
Example: For transferring data from a SQL database to a Blob Storage, you would: 
1. Create a linked service for the SQL database and Blob Storage. 
2. Defined datasets for each, specifying the schema or structure of the data.

In summary, datasets provide a structured representation of data stored in external systems, facilitating data operations in ADF.

### Question 6: What is the integration runtime in Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :** The integration runtime (IR) is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory to perform data movement, transformation, and dispatching activities.  Key Points about Integration Runtime:
- It provides the compute resources for data transfer and activity execution.
- Essential for running activities like Copy Activity or executing pipelines.
- Plays a significant role in pipeline costs as it determines the compute usage.

Example: When moving data from an on-premises SQL database to Azure Blob Storage, IR handles the compute required to copy the data. In short, integration runtime is the core component that powers the data transfer and transformations in Azure Data Factory.

### Question 7: What are mapping data flows in Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :** Mapping data flows are visual, no-code transformation tools in Azure Data Factory.
Key Points about Mapping Data Flows:
- Enable data transformations using a drag-and-drop interface.
- Do not require writing code, making them low-code solutions.
- Execute transformations using Spark clusters under the hood.
- Provide all the advantages of Spark without requiring Spark programming knowledge.

Example: If you need to clean and aggregate data from multiple sources, you can use mapping data flows to visually define these transformations, which will run on Spark.

### Question 8: What are triggers in Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :** Triggers in Azure Data Factory are mechanisms used to start pipeline executions based on specific conditions or schedules.
Key Points about Triggers:
- They define when and how pipelines are executed.
- Can be scheduled (e.g., run every 15 minutes or daily) or event-based (e.g., execute when a file is uploaded to Blob Storage).
- Commonly used to automate data workflows.

Example: A trigger can be set to execute a pipeline whenever a new file is added to a specific container in Blob Storage. Triggers provide a flexible way to schedule and automate pipeline executions in ADF.

### Question 9: What is the copy activity in Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :** The copy activity is a core activity in Azure Data Factory used to copy data from a source to a destination.

Key Points about Copy Activity:
- Supports "lift-and-shift" operations (copying data as-is).
- Can be configured for incremental data transfer (e.g., daily or hourly).
- Widely used for data migration tasks.

Example: Copy activity can transfer data from an on-premises SQL database to Azure Blob Storage, either in full or incrementally, depending on the pipeline configuration.
