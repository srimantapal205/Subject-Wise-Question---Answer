## 1. In Azure Data Factory (ADF) have 200 pipeline and this all are dependency pipeline also need to run all sequentially. How to resolve this problem?

**Answer :** Running 200 dependent pipelines sequentially in Azure Data Factory (ADF) can be done using a few different strategies. Here's a breakdown of the most efficient and manageable approaches:

### Approach 1: Master Pipeline (Recommended)
**Steps:**
* Create a Master Pipeline.

* Use the "Execute Pipeline" activity.

* Chain them sequentially:

* Link Execute Pipeline 1 to Execute Pipeline 2, then 3, and so on.

* Set the dependency condition to "Success" (default).

**Notes:**
* We can group sets of pipelines into smaller master pipelines (e.g., 20 at a time), then call those from a main orchestrator, if performance or UI gets sluggish.

*Use pipeline parameters if pipelines are similar and can be parameterized.

### Approach 2: Metadata-Driven Execution

Dynamic and scalable way to execute large number of pipelines without manually creating 200 Execute Pipeline activities.

**How it works:**
* Create a Lookup activity that reads a list of pipeline names (from a table or JSON in Blob).

* Use a ForEach loop to iterate over the list.

* Inside the loop, use Execute Pipeline activity to run the pipeline using the name from the list.

**Pros:**
* Easy to maintain.

* No need to hard-code all 200 pipelines in the ADF UI.

* Add/remove pipelines easily by updating metadata source.

**Caveat:**
* ForEach by default runs in parallel. You need to set "Batch Count" = 1 and uncheck "isSequential = false" to enforce sequential execution.


###  Approach 3: Use Data Factory Triggers + Dependency Chain
If you want to automatically kick off one pipeline after another based on success, you can chain them using triggers and pipeline dependencies in the ADF UI (Manage > Trigger > New/Edit).

But managing 200 trigger dependencies in this UI may be tedious and not scalable.

## 2. **What are the different types of activities in Azure Data Factory (ADF), and how are they used?**

---

### ✅ **Answer:**

In **Azure Data Factory**, **activities** define the **actions** or **operations** to be performed within a pipeline. ADF supports **different types of activities**, broadly categorized into the following:

---

### 1. **Data Movement Activities**
These activities are used to move data from a source to a destination.

- **Copy Activity**:  
  - Most commonly used activity.  
  - Transfers data between supported data stores.  
  - Supports transformations like column mapping and format conversion.  
  - Example: Copy data from Amazon S3 to Azure Blob Storage or from Blob to Azure SQL Database.

---

### 2. **Data Transformation Activities**
Used to transform or process data.

- **Data Flow Activity**:  
  - Executes mapping data flows (visually designed transformations).  
  - Allows schema mapping, joins, filters, aggregations, etc.  

- **Azure Databricks Notebook/Activity**:  
  - Triggers Databricks jobs for large-scale data transformations using Spark.

- **HDInsight Activity**:  
  - Executes Hive, Pig, or custom scripts on HDInsight clusters.

- **Stored Procedure Activity**:  
  - Executes stored procedures in SQL-based systems like Azure SQL Database or Synapse.

- **U-SQL, Hadoop, or ML Activities**:  
  - Executes specific processing logic using those technologies.

---

###  3. **Control Activities**
Used to control the pipeline flow, logic, and execution order.

- **Execute Pipeline Activity**:  
  - Runs a child pipeline from a parent pipeline.  
  - Useful for modular and reusable pipeline designs.

- **If Condition Activity**:  
  - Evaluates an expression and runs different activities based on true/false.

- **ForEach Activity**:  
  - Iterates over a collection of items and executes inner activities for each item.

- **Until Activity**:  
  - Repeats inner activities until a condition is met.

- **Wait Activity**:  
  - Introduces a delay before the next activity executes.

---

###  4. **External Activities**
Used to trigger external services or compute.

- **Web Activity**:  
  - Calls REST APIs to trigger external processes or send messages.  
  - Example: Call a webhook or trigger a Logic App.

- **Azure Function Activity**:  
  - Executes a serverless Azure Function.  
  - Example: Run custom logic like file renaming or data formatting.

- **Custom Activity**:  
  - Allows running custom .NET code on an Azure Batch service.

###  5. ** Azure Data Factory (ADF), optimization techniques**

In **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**, **optimization techniques** refer to a set of best practices and strategies used to improve the **performance**, **cost-efficiency**, and **reliability** of data pipelines. These techniques help in reducing pipeline execution time, improving resource utilization, and minimizing Azure costs.

Here’s a breakdown of **key Azure Data Factory optimization techniques**:

---

## 🔧 1. **Use Data Flow Performance Optimization**

When using **Mapping Data Flows** in ADF:

* **Partitioning**: Use optimized partitioning (like Hash or Round Robin) instead of default.
* **Broadcast Joins**: Use broadcast joins when one dataset is small enough to be loaded in memory.
* **Cache Lookups**: Cache small dimension tables in memory to avoid repeated lookups.
* **Reduce Data Shuffling**: Avoid transformations that cause unnecessary repartitioning (like joins or groupBy on high-cardinality columns).

---

## 🚀 2. **Optimize Copy Activity**

* **Use Staging**: For large datasets, use staging in Azure Blob/ADLS or Azure SQL for better throughput.
* **Parallel Copying**: Increase **parallel copy** settings based on the source/sink capacity (use `Data Integration Units (DIUs)`).
* **Compression**: Use compressed files (e.g., GZip, Snappy) to reduce network transfer time.
* **Column Pruning**: Select only required columns in the source dataset to reduce data size.

---

## 📅 3. **Efficient Pipeline Scheduling**

* Avoid frequent triggering of pipelines unless necessary (e.g., every 5 minutes can be costly).
* Use **event-based triggers** (e.g., blob creation) instead of time-based where possible.
* Batch small datasets into fewer runs to reduce the number of pipeline executions.

---

## 💰 4. **Cost Optimization**

* Use **Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR)** only when necessary (e.g., on-premises data).
* Shut down unused SHIR nodes and configure **Auto-shutdown**.
* Monitor activity runs and remove unused pipelines, datasets, and triggers.

---

## 📊 5. **Monitor and Tune with Azure Monitoring Tools**

* Use **Azure Monitor** and **ADF Pipeline Monitoring** to analyze performance bottlenecks.
* Look for long-running activities, retry attempts, and data skew.
* Enable **diagnostic logs** for detailed telemetry.

---

## 🧩 6. **Pipeline Design Optimization**

* Use **modular pipelines** with **pipeline parameters** and **templates** to simplify reuse and maintenance.
* Minimize number of activities per pipeline when possible (split into multiple if necessary).
* Use **Wait**, **Filter**, and **If Condition** activities carefully to avoid unnecessary delays.

---

## 🧠 7. **Use Appropriate Integration Runtime**

* **Azure IR**: Use for cloud-to-cloud data movement and transformation.
* **Self-hosted IR**: Use only when accessing on-premises or private network data.
* Choose **Auto-resolve IR** when unsure—ADF will choose the best region.

---

## 🔄 8. **Incremental Loads**

* Use **watermark columns** or **last modified datetime** for incremental data loads.
* Avoid full data loads every time—reduces data movement and processing time.

---

## 📁 9. **File and Dataset Management**

* Avoid too many small files (“small file problem”). Combine them into fewer, larger files.
* Use binary datasets for file-based copy and parsing downstream in Data Flow/Databricks if needed.

---

## 🧮 10. **Concurrency and Throughput**

* Use pipeline and activity **concurrency limits** appropriately.
* Configure pipeline concurrency under **General > Concurrency** to prevent resource throttling.

## 3. How to trigger adf pipeline on 14th working day?  
***Answer:*** Azure Data Factory (ADF) **does not natively support "working days"** (i.e., excluding weekends and/or holidays) in its trigger scheduling. However, there are **workarounds** to trigger a pipeline on the **14th working day** of the month.

---

### ✅ Recommended Approach (Using Azure Functions + ADF)

Use **ADF with Azure Function** or **Logic App** to evaluate the working day logic.

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Solution (Using Azure Function + ADF):

### 1. **Create an Azure Function** to check if the current day is the 14th working day of the month.

#### Sample Python logic:

```python
import datetime

def is_14th_working_day(today):
    count = 0
    day = datetime.date(today.year, today.month, 1)
    
    while day <= today:
        if day.weekday() < 5:  # Monday–Friday are 0–4
            count += 1
        if count == 14 and day == today:
            return True
        day += datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    
    return False

# Example usage
today = datetime.date.today()
if is_14th_working_day(today):
    # Trigger ADF pipeline
```

You can enhance this by adding a public holiday check using an API like [Calendarific](https://calendarific.com/) or a custom holiday list.

---

### 2. **Deploy Azure Function and expose HTTP endpoint**

* Configure the function to return `True/False` or trigger ADF directly using REST API.

---

### 3. **Create an ADF Pipeline with Web Activity**

* Add a **Web Activity** that calls the Azure Function.
* Use **If Condition** activity to run the main pipeline **only if the function returns `True`**.

---

### 4. **Schedule the Trigger in ADF**

* Create a **daily trigger** (e.g., every weekday at 8 AM).
* The pipeline logic will internally decide whether it’s the 14th working day.

---

## ✅ Alternate Option (Custom Table in SQL)

1. Create a **calendar table** with working days marked.

2. Create a Stored Procedure that:

   * Checks if today is 14th working day of the month.
   * Returns `True/False`.

3. Call this SP from ADF (Lookup activity + If Condition).

---

## ❌ Not Supported Directly:

* **ADF Triggers (Schedule/Event)** do not support:

  * Skipping weekends.
  * Complex calendar logic.

---

## 🔁 Summary Table:

| Approach           | Logic Handling     | Pros                        | Cons                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Azure Function     | Fully programmable | Flexible                    | Need to maintain               |
| SQL Calendar Table | Declarative        | Reusable for other purposes | Need calendar maintenance      |
| Pure ADF Trigger   | ✖                  | None                        | Can't handle working day logic |
