### Question 20: Is it mandatory to create an Integration Runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory (ADF)? Explain why.

**Answer :** No, it is not mandatory to create an Integration Runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory (ADF). When you create an Azure Data Factory account, you automatically get a default Integration Runtime called Auto Resolve Integration Runtime. This default IR works perfectly well for data movement and transformation within the cloud or across public networks.

However, if you need to transfer data from a private network or on-premises server to the cloud, you must create a Self-Hosted Integration Runtime. This is necessary to enable secure and seamless data migration in such scenarios.

### Question 21: Is it possible to call one pipeline from another pipeline in Azure Data Factory (ADF)? If yes, how?
**Answer :** Yes, it is possible to call one pipeline from another pipeline in Azure Data Factory (ADF). This can be achieved using the Execute Pipeline Activity.
Steps to call a pipeline from another pipeline:
- Add the Execute Pipeline Activity:
    - Open the parent pipeline in ADF Studio.
    - Search for the Execute Pipeline Activity in the activities pane.
    - Drag and drop it into the parent pipeline.
- Configure the activity:
    - In the settings tab of the Execute Pipeline Activity, select the child pipeline you want to invoke.
- Execution options:
    - Wait on Completion: If selected, the parent pipeline will wait for the child pipeline to complete before moving to the next activity.
    - Run in Parallel: If not selected, the parent pipeline will not wait for the child pipeline to complete and will continue executing subsequent activities in parallel.
- Terminology:
    - Parent Pipeline: The main pipeline that contains the Execute Pipeline Activity.
    - Child Pipeline: The pipeline being invoked through the Execute Pipeline Activity.
By using the Execute Pipeline Activity, you can easily manage pipeline dependencies and control their execution flow, ensuring either sequential or parallel processing based on your requirements.


### Question 22: How can you ensure that while pulling data from an on-premises database server for multiple tables using a copy activity inside a ForEach loop in Azure Data Factory (ADF), only one database request is sent at a time?
**Answer :** Yes, it is possible to ensure that only one database request is sent at a time when using a ForEach loop for pulling data from multiple tables in Azure Data Factory.
**Solution:**
1. Set the ForEach Activity to Sequential Mode:
    - In ADF, the ForEach activity can be configured to run in either parallel or sequential mode.
    - To ensure only one database request is sent at a time, you need to set the ForEach activity to sequential mode.
2. Steps to Configure:
    - Open the ForEach activity in your pipeline.
    - Go to the Settings tab.
    - Enable the Sequential option.
3. Behavior:
    - In sequential mode, the ForEach activity will process each iteration one at a time.
    - Inside the ForEach loop, the Copy Activity will execute for one table, complete the operation, and then proceed to the next table.
**Advantages:**
    - Prevents overloading the on-premises database server with multiple simultaneous requests, which could cause performance issues or server downtime.
**Disadvantage:**
- Running in sequential mode can increase the total execution time since only one table is processed at a time.
Practical Use Case:
- Use parallel mode when the server can handle concurrent requests and the goal is to minimize execution time.
- Use sequential mode when the on-premises server has limited resources or cannot handle multiple parallel requests effectively.

By configuring the ForEach activity in sequential mode, you ensure that each tableâ€™s data is copied one at a time, thereby adhering to the requirement of sending only 
one request to the on-premises database at a time.


### Question 23: You are moving data from an on-premises database to Azure Cloud using Azure Data Factory (ADF). What are the necessary steps to ensure the pipeline executes successfully?
**Answer :** To successfully move data from an on-premises database to Azure Cloud using Azure Data Factory, follow these steps:

1. Create a Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR):
    - Since data is being moved from a private network (on-premises) to Azure, you need a Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) for connectivity.
    - Install and configure SHIR on a machine within the on-premises environment that has access to the database.
    - Ensure the SHIR is up and running and properly registered with your Azure Data Factory.

2. Create a Linked Service Using SHIR:
    - Create a Linked Service in Azure Data Factory to establish a connection with the on-premises database.
    - In the Linked Service configuration:
        - Specify the database type (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle).
        - Select the Self-Hosted Integration Runtime you created.
        - Provide the necessary authentication details (e.g., credentials, server name, database name).

3. Create a Dataset:
    - Create a Dataset to represent the source data (on-premises table) and the target data (Azure storage or database).
    - Link the source dataset to the Linked Service for the on-premises database.
    - Create the target dataset linked to the Azure storage or database Linked Service.

4. Configure the Copy Activity:
    - Use the Copy Activity in your pipeline to transfer data from the source dataset to the target dataset.
    - In the activity, map the source and target datasets.
    - Configure additional settings like data mapping and performance optimization if needed.

5. Test and Run the Pipeline:
    - Test the pipeline to ensure proper connectivity and data transfer.
    - Once verified, run the pipeline to execute the data migration.

Key Considerations:
- Network Access: Ensure the machine running SHIR has network access to both the on-premises database and the Azure environment.
- Firewall and Security: Open necessary ports and configure firewall rules to allow communication between SHIR and Azure Data Factory.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling and retry logic in the pipeline to account for potential connectivity issues.
- Performance: Optimize the pipeline settings to handle large datasets efficiently.
By following these steps, you can ensure the pipeline runs successfully and migrates data securely from the on-premises database to Azure Cloud.

### Question 24: How can you ensure that data movement between an Azure SQL Database and Azure Storage within the same region (e.g., US East) does not violate compliance by moving data outside the region during an Azure Data Factory (ADF) copy activity?
**Answer :** To ensure data movement stays within the same region and complies with regulations, you need to configure a custom Azure Integration Runtime (IR) and avoid relying on the default Auto-Resolve IR. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Understanding the Issue:
    - The default Auto-Resolve Integration Runtime attempts to allocate resources within the same region as your source and target.
    - However, if resources in the region are unavailable during execution, it may allocate resources in a different region, potentially violating compliance requirements.
2. Solution: To guarantee that the data does not leave the region:
    1. Create a Custom Azure Integration Runtime:
        - Open Azure Data Factory Studio.
        - Go to the Manage tab and select Integration Runtime.
        - Click New and choose Azure as the type of integration runtime.
        - During the configuration, explicitly select the desired region (e.g., US East).
    2. Use the Custom Integration Runtime in Linked Services:
        - Update the Linked Services connected to your source (Azure SQL Database) and target (Azure Storage).
        - Assign the custom Azure Integration Runtime you created to ensure all data movement occurs within the specified region.
    3. Run the Pipeline:
        - Use the pipeline as usual. The custom Azure IR ensures data processing remains within the defined region.
3. Steps Recap:
- Integration Runtime:
    - Create a custom Azure Integration Runtime and explicitly select the desired region during setup.
- Linked Services:
    - Configure linked services to use the custom IR.
- Pipeline Execution:
    - Verify that the pipeline runs using the custom IR, ensuring regional compliance.

4. Why This Works:
By explicitly assigning an Azure Integration Runtime tied to a specific region, you eliminate the risk of ADF using integration runtime resources outside the intended region, thereby ensuring compliance with data residency requirements.

This approach guarantees that all data movement operations stay confined to the selected region, adhering to strict compliance standards.

### Question 24: How can you ensure that data movement between an Azure SQL Database and Azure Storage in the same region (e.g., US East) complies with the requirement that data should not leave the region, using Azure Data Factory (ADF)?

**Answer :** To ensure compliance with data residency requirements and avoid any possibility of data leaving the specified region, you need to configure a custom Azure Integration Runtime (IR). Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Issue with Auto-Resolve IR:
The default Auto-Resolve Integration Runtime attempts to allocate resources in the same region as the source and target.
- Challenge: If resources in the region are unavailable at runtime, the Auto-Resolve IR may allocate resources from a different region, causing data to move outside the intended region.

2. Solution Steps: To eliminate this risk, you can create a Custom Azure Integration Runtime:

1. Create a Custom Azure Integration Runtime
    1. Open Azure Data Factory Studio.
    2. Navigate to the Manage tab.
    3. Under Integration Runtime, click New.
    4. Choose Azure as the type of integration runtime.
    5. During configuration, explicitly select the region (e.g., US East).
    6. Complete the creation process to ensure the integration runtime is tied to the desired region.
2. Configure Linked Services
    1. Update the linked services for both the source (Azure SQL Database) and the target (Azure Storage).
    2. Assign the newly created Custom Azure Integration Runtime to these linked services.
3. Run the Pipeline
    - Execute the pipeline.
    - The custom Azure Integration Runtime ensures all processing and data movement occur within the defined region.

3. Why This Works:
A Custom Azure Integration Runtime provides full control over the region in which the integration runtime operates. By explicitly defining the region (e.g., US East), you prevent data movement or processing from occurring outside that region, ensuring compliance with data residency policies.

4. Key Considerations:
    - While Auto-Resolve IR is convenient, it does not guarantee regional compliance if resources are constrained.
    - A Custom Azure Integration Runtime is a preferred approach for scenarios requiring strict regional control.
This solution ensures compliance and eliminates the risk of accidental data movement outside the specified region.


### Question 25: How can you implement a nested ForEach loop in Azure Data Factory (ADF) when ADF does not natively support nesting ForEach activities?

**Answer :** Azure Data Factory currently does not allow direct nesting of ForEach activities. However, you can achieve the desired functionality by leveraging the Execute Pipeline activity to mimic nested loops. Hereâ€™s how you can do it step by step:

##### Solution Steps:

##### Step 1: Create Two Pipelines
1. Pipeline 1 (Parent Pipeline):
        â—‹ Add a ForEach activity that iterates over the outer collection.
        â—‹ Inside this ForEach, add an Execute Pipeline activity to call Pipeline 2.
2. Pipeline 2 (Child Pipeline):
        â—‹ Add a ForEach activity that iterates over the inner collection.
        â—‹ Implement the required activities inside this loop to process the inner loop logic.

##### Step 2: Configure the Parent Pipeline (Pipeline 1)
1. Add a ForEach activity to iterate over the outer collection.
2. Inside the ForEach, drag and drop an Execute Pipeline activity.
3. Configure the Execute Pipeline activity to invoke Pipeline 2.
4. Pass any required parameters from the outer loop (Pipeline 1) to the inner loop (Pipeline 2).

#####  Step 3: Configure the Child Pipeline (Pipeline 2)
1. Add a ForEach activity to iterate over the inner collection.
2. Include the activities needed to process the data within this loop.
3. Ensure the child pipeline accepts input parameters passed from the parent pipeline.
Example Use Case:
1. Outer Loop (Pipeline 1): Iterate through a list of database names.
2. Inner Loop (Pipeline 2): For each database, iterate through its tables and perform a copy operation for each table.

#### Why This Works:
The Execute Pipeline activity allows modular design by invoking one pipeline from another. This enables a workaround for nested ForEach loops by splitting the logic across multiple pipelines.

**Key Benefits:**
1. Scalability: Modular pipelines are easier to manage and debug.
2. Reusability: The child pipeline can be reused for other scenarios requiring similar inner-loop logic.
3. Flexibility: Enables complex workflows that mimic nested loops while adhering to ADF's current limitations.

**Limitations:**
- May introduce slightly increased latency due to inter-pipeline execution overhead.
- Requires careful parameter management to ensure seamless data flow between parent and child pipelines.


### Question 26: How do you move your Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline from development to another environment like UAT or production? What best practices should you follow?
**Answer :** To move your Azure Data Factory pipeline from development to another environment such as UAT or production, follow these steps and best practices:
#### Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. Integrate Azure Data Factory with Version Control
    - Use Azure DevOps Git or GitHub for version control.
    - Enable Git integration in the Azure Data Factory.
    - Maintain separate branches for each environment:
        - Development Branch: For active development.
        - UAT Branch: For testing.
        - Production Branch: For live, production-ready code.
2. Development and Publishing
    - Develop and test pipelines in the development branch.
    - Once the development is complete, publish the changes. This action generates an ARM template in the Azure Data Factory's Git repository.
3. Raise a Pull Request
    - Raise a pull request to merge the development branch into the UAT or production branch.
    - Add a detailed description of the changes made.
    - A reviewer (team lead or peer) will assess the changes for accuracy and adherence to standards.
4. Use Azure DevOps Release Pipelines
    - After the pull request is merged, an Azure DevOps Release Pipeline will automatically deploy the changes to the target environment.
    - The release pipeline performs these actions:
        1. Extracts the ARM templates from the Git repository.
        2. Deploys the ARM templates to the target Azure Data Factory environment.

#### Best Practices:
1. Maintain Separate Data Factory Environments
    - Use different Azure Data Factory instances for each environment (e.g., Dev, UAT, Prod).
    - Ensure the configurations, such as linked services, are parameterized to adapt to different environments.
2. Parameterize the Pipeline
    - Use global parameters and pipeline parameters to handle differences between environments (e.g., connection strings, storage account names).
3. Automate Deployment
    - Automate the deployment process using Azure DevOps release pipelines. This ensures consistency and reduces manual errors.
    - Use ARM templates for deployment, which provide infrastructure as code capabilities.
4. Secure Access
    - Ensure access to the production environment is restricted to authorized personnel only.
    - Use managed identities and Key Vault integration for secure handling of credentials.
5. Monitor and Validate
    - Monitor the deployment pipeline for errors or warnings.
    - After deployment, validate the pipeline functionality in the target environment to ensure it works as expected.
6. Use CI/CD Practices
    - Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for an efficient and reliable deployment process.
    - Use Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to automate the build and release process.




### Question 27: You are informed that your production pipeline, which was working fine earlier, has suddenly stopped working. What steps will you take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue?

By following this structured troubleshooting process, you can systematically identify and resolve the issue, ensuring minimal downtime and restoring pipeline functionality efficiently.



### Question 28: How would you create an incremental pipeline to pull data from an on-premises database to Azure SQL Database on a daily basis?
**Answer :** To create an incremental pipeline in Azure Data Factory (ADF), the high watermark concept can be utilized. Here's a detailed explanation of how to implement this approach:
High Watermark Concept

-   High Watermark File/Table: This acts as a storage for the last execution timestamp. Initially, this timestamp can be set to an old date (e.g., 100 years ago).
-   Purpose: To fetch only new or updated records (incremental data) from the source database by comparing timestamps.

Steps to Create the Incremental Pipeline
1. Initialize High Watermark
 - Create a high watermark table/file in your Azure SQL Database.
 - Add a column to store the last execution date.
 - Initially, set the date to an old value (e.g., 1900-01-01).
2. ADF Pipeline Design
The pipeline consists of the following activities:
* Activity 1: Lookup Activity
    - Purpose: Fetch the last execution date from the high watermark table.
    - Configuration: Connect to the high watermark table using a linked service.
    - Query the table to retrieve the last execution date. Example: SELECT LastExecutionDate FROM HighWatermarkTable
* Activity 2: Lookup/Derived Column Activity
    - Purpose: Fetch the latest update date from the source on-premises table.
    - Configuration:
        + Use a linked service connected to your on-premises database.
        + Query the table to get the latest update timestamp. Example:

    SELECT MAX(LastModifiedDate) AS MaxDate FROM SourceTable

* Activity 3: Copy Activity (Incremental Data Load)
    - Purpose: Pull incremental data between the two dates.
    - Configuration:
        + Use the last execution date (from Activity 1) and the latest update date (from Activity 2) as parameters.
        + Query the source table for records updated between these dates. Example:

    SELECT * FROM SourceTable
    WHERE LastModifiedDate > @LastExecutionDate
      AND LastModifiedDate <= @MaxDate
- Write the results to Azure SQL Database.

* Activity 4: Copy Activity (Update High Watermark)
    - Purpose: Update the high watermark table with the new last execution date.
    - Configuration:
        - Use the latest update date (from Activity 2) as the new high watermark.
        - Write this date to the high watermark table. Example:

    UPDATE HighWatermarkTable
    SET LastExecutionDate = @MaxDate

**Pipeline Workflow**
1. First Run:
    - Fetches all data from the source table since the initial high watermark (e.g., 100 years ago).
    - Updates the high watermark table with the latest timestamp.
2. Subsequent Runs:
    - Fetches only the new/updated records between the last execution date and the current timestamp.
    - Updates the high watermark with the latest timestamp after data ingestion.

**Considerations**
- Performance:
    + Ensure proper indexing on the timestamp column in the source table to optimize query performance.
- Fault Tolerance:
    + Configure retries for transient failures.
    + Use a retry mechanism in case the pipeline fails to ensure no data loss.
- Monitoring:
    + Set up alerts to monitor pipeline execution status.

By following this high watermark-based approach, you ensure efficient and reliable incremental data loading from an on-premises database to Azure SQL Database.

### Question 30: Assume there is a business requirement where an external application drops a file in a Blob Storage account. Your pipeline has to pick this file and push the data into an Azure SQL Database. How would you design the solution using Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :**
To design the solution:
1. Define Source and Destination:
    - Source: Azure Blob Storage.
    - Destination: Azure SQL Database.
2. Pipeline Setup:
    - Use a Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.
    - Set Blob Storage as the source and SQL Database as the sink in the Copy Activity.
3. Triggering the Pipeline:
    - Implement a Storage Event Trigger for automation.
        - This trigger activates the pipeline whenever a file is dropped in a specific Blob Storage location.
        - Configure the trigger with the following:
            + Specify the storage account and container name.
            + Optionally, use a regular expression to match specific file names.
            + Choose the event type, such as "New Blob Created."
        - Alternative triggers:
            + Scheduled Trigger: Run the pipeline at a fixed frequency (e.g., hourly, daily).
            + Tumbling Window Trigger: Execute the pipeline at regular intervals while maintaining a state.
4. Steps in Azure Data Factory Studio:
    - Open the pipeline in the Azure Data Factory studio.
    - Add a trigger by selecting "Add Trigger" and then "New."
    - Choose Storage Event as the trigger type.
    - Configure the trigger with the required settings for storage account, container, and file details.

**This setup ensures an automated, end-to-end process:**
- The file is dropped in Blob Storage.
- The event trigger activates the pipeline.
- The Copy Activity transfers the data to Azure SQL Database.
    
### Question 31: Assume there is a business requirement where your pipeline is copying data from source to destination. You want to receive an email notification whenever the copy activity fails. How would you design this solution using Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :**
**To design the solution:**
1. Create the Pipeline:
    - Set up a pipeline in Azure Data Factory with a Copy Activity to transfer data from source to destination.
2. Set Up a Logic App for Email Notifications:
    - Go to the Azure portal and create a Logic App.
    - Configure the Logic App to be triggered by a REST API call.
    - Add an action in the Logic App to send an email using Outlook or another email service.
        - Specify email parameters such as subject, recipient, and body.
    - Save the Logic App and note its trigger URL.
3. Integrate the Logic App with the Pipeline:
    - Add a Web Activity in the pipeline.
    - Configure the Web Activity to call the Logic App's REST API by specifying the Logic App trigger URL.
    - Pass parameters like email subject, recipient, and error details from the pipeline to the Logic App.
4. Configure the Failure Condition:
    - Set the Web Activity to execute only when the Copy Activity fails by configuring the pipeline's dependency condition for failure.
5. Steps in Azure Data Factory Studio:
    - Create a new pipeline and add a Copy Activity for data transfer.
    - Add a Web Activity and configure it with the Logic App URL.
    - Set the Web Activity to trigger only on failure of the Copy Activity.
6. Customizing Email Notifications:
    - Pass dynamic content (e.g., error details, activity name) from the pipeline to the Logic App for personalized email messages.
    - Use the HTTP POST method in the Web Activity to send these details to the Logic App.

**This setup ensures that:**

- The pipeline operates normally for successful copy activities.

- In case of failure, the Logic App sends an automated email notification with relevant error details.

### Question 32: Assume you are developing a pipeline that copies data from source to destination. This pipeline runs daily, and you need to create a folder hierarchy to store the file in a proper date format. The folder structure should dynamically change based on the date the pipeline runs. How would you design this solution using Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :**
**To design the solution:**
1. Pipeline Overview:
    - Create a pipeline with a Copy Activity that transfers data from the source to the destination.
2. Dynamic Folder Path:
    - Use a dynamic path for the destination folder based on the current date.
    - Utilize the formatDateTime function to dynamically generate the folder structure in the format Year/Month/Day.
3. Steps to Implement:
    - In the Copy Activity destination settings, specify the folder path dynamically:
    @concat(formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'yyyy'), '/', formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'MM'), '/', formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'dd'))
    - utcNow() provides the current timestamp.
    - formatDateTime() formats the timestamp to extract the year, month, and day.
    - concat() combines these components into a single folder path string.
4. Dataset Configuration:
    - Create or use an existing dataset for the destination.
    - In the File Path section of the dataset configuration:
        - Â§ Enable dynamic content.
        - Â§ Add the expression using the formatDateTime function to generate the dynamic folder structure.
5. Result:
    - When the pipeline runs:
        - For today's date, the file is saved in Year/Month/Day format (e.g., 2024/12/31).
        - On subsequent days, the folder structure dynamically updates based on the current date.
6. Azure Data Factory Studio Implementation:
    - Navigate to the pipeline in Azure Data Factory Studio.
    - Open the Copy Activity settings.
    - Configure the destination path dynamically using the above expression in the File Path section.

This setup ensures that the folder hierarchy is automatically created based on the current date, providing an organized and date-specific file storage structure.



### Question 33: Assume you are developing a pipeline that copies data from a REST API source to a destination. The pipeline runs daily, and the REST endpoints are dynamic, with the URL containing a date parameter that changes based on the pipeline's execution day. How would you design this solution using Azure Data Factory?
**Answer :**
** To design the solution:**
1. Pipeline Structure:
    - Create a pipeline with a Copy Activity to copy data from the REST API source to the destination.
2. REST API as Source:
    - Create a REST linked service with the base URL of the API (e.g., https://abc.com).
    - Create a REST dataset associated with the linked service.
3. Dynamic Relative URL:
    - In the REST dataset, set the Relative URL dynamically using the formatDateTime function and utcNow().
    - For example, construct the dynamic relative URL as follows:
    
    @concat('/BBM/', formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'yyyy-MM-dd'))

4. Execution in Azure Data Factory Studio:
    - Create the Linked Service:
        - In Azure Data Factory, define the REST linked service with the base URL.
        - For public APIs, specify anonymous authentication; for private APIs, provide necessary credentials.
    - Define the Dataset:
        - Use the REST linked service in the dataset configuration.
        - In the Relative URL field, use the dynamic expression to append the date parameter to the base URL.
    - Configure the Copy Activity:
        - Use the REST dataset as the source.
        - Define the destination dataset, such as Azure Blob Storage or Azure SQL Database.
5. Outcome:
    - Each pipeline run generates a dynamic REST endpoint for the respective day's data.
    - The data is copied from the dynamically generated REST endpoint to the destination efficiently.

This method ensures that the REST endpoint dynamically adjusts to fetch the appropriate data based on the current execution date, aligning with the daily run schedule of the pipeline.


### Question 34: How would you design a solution to copy data automatically from multiple files in a folder, where each file corresponds to a specific table in a database, and the file names match the table names?

**Answer :**
    1. Pipeline Design:
        â—‹ Use Azure Data Factory (ADF) to create a data pipeline.
    2. Step-by-Step Implementation:
        â—‹ Get Metadata Activity:
            Â§ Use this activity to list all files in the specified folder.
            Â§ Configure it to fetch the Child Items property, which provides the list of files.
        â—‹ ForEach Activity:
            Â§ Pass the output of the Get Metadata activity (list of file names) to a ForEach activity to iterate through each file.
        â—‹ Copy Activity:
            Â§ Inside the ForEach activity, use a Copy Activity to copy data from the file to the corresponding table.
            Â§ Configure the source and sink dynamically:
                â–¡ Source:
                    Â® Create a parameterized dataset for the file source.
                    Â® Pass the current file name (currentItem.name) dynamically to the file path parameter.
                â–¡ Sink:
                    Â® Create a parameterized dataset for the database table.
                    Â® Extract the table name by splitting the file name (e.g., removing the extension) using the split() function.
                    Â® Pass the extracted table name as a parameter to the sink dataset.
    3. Dynamic Configuration:
        â—‹ File Path:
            Â§ Use a parameterized source dataset where the file name is passed dynamically during each iteration.
        â—‹ Table Name:
            Â§ Extract the table name by splitting the file name (e.g., fileName.split('.')[0]) to remove the extension.
    4. Handling Extensions:
        â—‹ Use a split function in ADF expressions to separate the base file name from the extension.
    5. Scalability:
        â—‹ The solution supports multiple files dynamically. Even if there are more files in the folder, the pipeline iterates through all files and processes them.
    6. Final Notes:
        â—‹ Ensure linked services for storage and database are correctly set up.
        â—‹ Validate parameterization to avoid errors in dynamic dataset configurations.


### Question 35: In which scenario would you use a Linked Self-Hosted Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory?

**Answer :**
A Linked Self-Hosted Integration Runtime is used when you want to reuse an existing Self-Hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) that has already been set up by another team or project within the organization, rather than creating a new SHIR. This helps in reducing costs and reusing resources effectively.

Scenarios for Using Linked Self-Hosted Integration Runtime:
    1. Cross-Team Collaboration:
        â—‹ Two or more teams within the same organization are using different Azure Data Factory (ADF) instances.
        â—‹ One team has already set up a SHIR on a virtual machine, and the other team wants to utilize the same SHIR instead of creating a new one.
    2. Cost Efficiency:
        â—‹ Avoids the overhead of provisioning a new virtual machine and installing another SHIR, saving costs on infrastructure and maintenance.
    3. Bandwidth Sharing:
        â—‹ If the existing SHIR has sufficient bandwidth and resources, it can support multiple teams or ADF instances simultaneously.
    4. Centralized Integration Runtime Management:
        â—‹ Centralized management of SHIR across multiple ADF instances simplifies administration and ensures consistency.

How to Set Up a Linked Self-Hosted Integration Runtime:
    1. Go to the Manage tab in Azure Data Factory Studio.
    2. Select Integration Runtime and click + New.
    3. Choose Azure Self-Hosted and select Linked Self-Hosted Integration Runtime.
    4. Provide the Resource ID of the existing SHIR from the other team or ADF instance.
    5. Establish the connection, and the linked SHIR can now be used in the current ADF instance.

Benefits:
    â€¢ Resource Optimization: Leverages existing infrastructure.
    â€¢ Reduced Setup Time: Avoids redundant configuration.
    â€¢ Cost Savings: Eliminates the need for additional virtual machines or integration runtimes.


### Question 37: How would you handle a scenario where some rows in a file do not match the table schema, causing the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory to fail?

**Answer :**
To handle schema mismatches and avoid the failure of the entire Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory (ADF), you can enable fault tolerance and logging. This ensures that the rows causing issues are skipped and logged, while the rest of the data is successfully copied.

Steps to Handle the Issue:
    1. Enable Fault Tolerance:
        â—‹ In the Copy Activity, go to the Settings tab.
        â—‹ Enable the Fault Tolerance option.
        â—‹ Select the Skip Incompatible Rows option.
            Â§ This ensures rows with schema mismatches (e.g., missing or extra columns) are skipped instead of causing the activity to fail.
    2. Enable Logging:
        â—‹ Under Settings, enable the Enable Logging option.
        â—‹ Configure a storage location (e.g., Azure Blob Storage or Data Lake) to save the log files.
        â—‹ Specify the logging level:
            Â§ Warning or Info to capture details about the skipped rows.
    3. Logging Failed Rows:
        â—‹ The skipped rows will be logged in a specified file at the chosen storage location.
        â—‹ This file contains details of the failed rows, which can be reviewed and corrected if needed.
    4. Pipeline Execution:
        â—‹ When the pipeline is executed:
            Â§ Rows matching the schema are successfully inserted into the table.
            Â§ Mismatched rows are skipped and logged without causing the pipeline to fail.

Example:
    â€¢ Scenario:
        â—‹ A file contains 10,000 rows.
        â—‹ 9,990 rows match the schema and are inserted successfully.
        â—‹ 10 rows have schema mismatches (e.g., extra/missing columns).
    â€¢ Outcome:
        â—‹ 9,990 rows are copied to the target table.
        â—‹ 10 mismatched rows are skipped and logged in a file.

Benefits:
    â€¢ Ensures partial success of the pipeline, avoiding a complete failure.
    â€¢ Provides detailed logs for troubleshooting the skipped rows.
    â€¢ Implements best practices for data loading by maintaining pipeline reliability.

Use Case Example in ADF:
    1. Add a Copy Activity to the pipeline.
    2. Configure the source (e.g., CSV file) and sink (e.g., SQL table).
    3. In the Settings tab:
        â—‹ Enable Fault Tolerance and set it to Skip Incompatible Rows.
        â—‹ Enable Logging and set a storage location for the log files.
    4. Run the pipeline. Rows with mismatched schemas are skipped and logged.
This approach ensures efficient handling of data mismatches while providing visibility into the failed rows for corrective action.


### Question 38: How can you improve the performance of a Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory if it is working very slowly?

**Answer :**Performance optimization for Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory (ADF) can be achieved at various levels. Below are strategies you can apply:

1. Increase the Data Integration Unit (DIU):
    â€¢ What is DIU?
        â—‹ Data Integration Unit (DIU) is a combination of CPU, memory, and network resource allocation for your data movement. Higher DIUs provide more resources, resulting in faster performance.
    â€¢ How to Configure:
        â—‹ Go to the Settings tab in the Copy Activity.
        â—‹ Increase the DIU value (range: 2 to 256).
        â—‹ By default, ADF uses Auto DIU, starting with 4 and scaling up as needed. For better performance, set a higher DIU value (e.g., 16, 32).
    â€¢ Trade-off:
        â—‹ Higher DIUs increase performance but also cost more.

2. Enable Staging:
    â€¢ What is Staging?
        â—‹ Involves temporarily storing data in a staging area (e.g., Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake) before transferring it to the destination.
    â€¢ Benefits:
        â—‹ Useful for handling large data volumes.
        â—‹ Allows data to be transferred in bulk from the staging area, improving performance.
    â€¢ How to Enable:
        â—‹ In the Settings tab of the Copy Activity, enable the Staging option.
        â—‹ Configure the temporary storage location for staging.

3. Optimize File Format:
    â€¢ Choose Efficient Formats:
        â—‹ Use binary formats like Parquet or Avro instead of CSV or JSON, as they are optimized for big data processing.
    â€¢ Why it Helps:
        â—‹ Binary formats reduce file size and processing time, leading to faster data transfer and transformation.

4. Optimize Source Queries and Data Partitioning:
    â€¢ Query Optimization:
        â—‹ If using a query to extract data, optimize the SQL query to reduce the data size and complexity.
    â€¢ Partition Data:
        â—‹ Partition large datasets by splitting data into smaller chunks (e.g., by date, region, etc.).
        â—‹ Use parallelism to process partitions concurrently.

5. Improve Database and Network Performance:
    â€¢ Database Tuning:
        â—‹ Ensure proper indexing and optimize table schema in the target database.
    â€¢ Network Bandwidth:
        â—‹ Ensure sufficient network bandwidth between the source, staging, and destination.

6. Enable Compression:
    â€¢ Compress data during transfer to reduce size and speed up data movement.

Example in Azure Data Factory:
    1. Add a Copy Activity to your pipeline.
    2. Configure source and destination datasets.
    3. In the Settings tab:
        â—‹ Set DIU to a higher value (e.g., 16 or 32).
        â—‹ Enable Staging and configure the temporary storage location.
    4. If applicable, switch the file format to Parquet or Avro.

Additional Tips:
    â€¢ Monitor pipeline performance using ADF's Monitor feature.
    â€¢ Enable logging to identify bottlenecks.
    â€¢ Use Azure Integration Runtime if the source/destination is within Azure to reduce latency.
By applying these strategies, you can significantly enhance the performance of your Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.



### Question 38: What are the scenarios where copy activities and mapping configuration would be useful?
**Answer :** Mapping configuration is useful in scenarios where there are differences between the source and destination data source schemas. For example, if a column in the source is named "cost" and in the destination, it is named "price," even though they represent the same data, the system will not automatically map them. In such cases, you can explicitly define the mapping to ensure correct data transfer. In Azure Data Factory, you can use the "Import schema" option to automatically generate the mapping, or you can manually specify the column mappings.

### Question 39: Assume that your pipeline failed at the second activity. To avoid data inconsistency, you have been asked to rerun the pipeline from the failed activity. Can we do this? If yes or no, give the reason.
**Answer :** Yes, it is possible to rerun the pipeline from the failed activity. In Azure Data Factory, you can go to the "Monitor" tab, open the failed pipeline, and you'll find an option to rerun the pipeline starting from the failed activity. This avoids the need to rerun the entire pipeline from the beginning, which is particularly useful in incremental pipelines with multiple activities.
