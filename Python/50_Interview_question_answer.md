---

2. **Difference between list, tuple, set, and dictionary?**

```python
lst = [1, 2, 3]       # mutable, ordered, allows duplicates
tpl = (1, 2, 3)       # immutable, ordered
st  = {1, 2, 2, 3}    # mutable, unordered, unique values
dct = {"a": 1, "b": 2} # key-value pairs
```

---

    data = f.read()
```

---

25. **Difference between `assert` and exception handling?**
