Write a SQL query using a Common Table Expression (CTE)						
Combine online and store orders into a single dataset using UNION. Add a column channel with values 'online' or 'store' to distinguish the source.	



				
For each customer: 						
Calculate the total amount spent.


Determine the first and most recent purchase date.						
Compute the running total of amount spent ordered by order date using a window function.						
Filter the result to include only customers whose total amount spent > 300.	



					
Convert the order date to 'YYYY-MM' format and format the amount to 2 decimal places.						
Return: customer_id, customer_name, channel, order_month, order_amount, running_total, first_order_date, last_order_date.â€ƒ
