+ Implementing change data capture (CDC) mechanisms in the source systems.
+ Using lookup and conditional split activities in ADF to separate new/changed data from the rest.

### 9. What are Delta Lake tables and why are they important in big data processing?

**Answer**: Delta Lake tables are an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads. They enable reliable and scalable data lakes with features like versioned data, schema enforcement, and the ability to handle streaming and batch data in a unified manner. They ensure data integrity and consistency, making them essential for complex data processing pipelines.

### 10. How can you implement security and compliance in an Azure Data Lake?

**Answer**: Security and compliance in an Azure Data Lake can be implemented by:
+ Using Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication and fine-grained access control.
+ Applying Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
+ Encrypting data at rest and in transit.
+ Monitoring and auditing access and activity using Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center.
+ Implementing data governance policies and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
