# ðŸ”¹ **Power BI Interview Questions & Answers**

---

## **Mid-Level (25 Questions)**

### 1. What are the main components of Power BI?

**Answer:**

* Power BI Desktop (report authoring)
* Power BI Service (cloud-based publishing & collaboration)
* Power BI Mobile (viewing reports)
* Power BI Gateway (on-premises data refresh/connection)
* Power BI Report Server (on-premises report hosting)

---

### 2. Difference between DirectQuery, Import, and Live Connection?

**Answer:**

* **Import**: Data copied into PBIX; best for performance.
* **DirectQuery**: Data remains in source; queries run on-demand.
* **Live Connection**: Real-time connection to SSAS (Tabular/Multidimensional).
  **Use Case**: Import for smaller datasets, DirectQuery for large/real-time, Live for enterprise SSAS.

---

### 3. What is a Gateway in Power BI? Types?

**Answer:**

* A **gateway** bridges on-premises data sources and Power BI Service.
* **Types**:

  * **On-premises Gateway** â€“ enterprise use, scheduling, multiple sources

---

### 4. How do you handle performance issues in Power BI reports?

**Answer:**

* Optimize DAX calculations
* Use star schema, avoid snowflake
* Use aggregations/pre-calculated tables
* Filter unnecessary columns/rows during ETL
* Use Import mode where possible
* Optimize visuals (limit slicers, use fewer visuals)

---

### 5. Explain Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema in Power BI.

**Answer:**

* **Star Schema**: Fact table at center connected to denormalized dimension tables â†’ faster queries, simpler.
* **Snowflake Schema**: Dimensions normalized into multiple related tables â†’ complex, slower performance.
  **Best Practice**: Always use **star schema** for Power BI.

---

### 6. What is a Fact Table and Dimension Table?

**Answer:**

* **Fact Table**: Contains numeric measures (e.g., sales amount, quantity).
* **Dimension Table**: Contains descriptive attributes (e.g., product, region, time).

---

### 7. What is Row-level Security (RLS) in Power BI?

**Answer:**

* Restricts data access at the row level using **roles & DAX filters**.
* Example: `[Region] = "East"` â†’ users only see East region data.
* Can use **Static RLS** (predefined roles) or **Dynamic RLS** (based on user identity via `USERNAME()` function).

---

### 8. What is the difference between a Calculated Column and a Measure?

**Answer:**

* **Calculated Column**: Computed at row-level, stored in the model (increases size).
* **Measure**: Computed on aggregation/context, calculated at runtime (better performance).

### 9. What are Hierarchies in Power BI?

**Answer:**

* Logical levels of data (e.g., Year â†’ Quarter â†’ Month â†’ Day).
* Helps drill-down in visuals.

---

### 10. Explain Aggregations in Power BI.

**Answer:**

* Pre-calculated summary tables that speed up queries on large fact tables.

---

### 11. Explain difference between Calculated Table and Table in Power Query.

**Answer:**

* **Calculated Table**: Created using DAX after loading data.
* **Power Query Table**: Transformed/created during ETL before loading into model.

---

### 15. How do you optimize a Power BI dataset size?

**Answer:**

* Remove unnecessary columns/rows
* Use proper data types (Int instead of String)
* Avoid high cardinality columns
* Use **Aggregations**
* Prefer Measures over Calculated Columns

---

### 16. Difference between ALL, ALLSELECTED, REMOVEFILTERS in DAX?

**Answer:**

* **ALL**: Ignores all filters.
* **ALLSELECTED**: Respects user selections but ignores visual filters.
* **REMOVEFILTERS**: Newer, same as ALL but more readable.

---

### 17. Explain Difference between SUM and SUMX.

**Answer:**

* **SUM**: Aggregates column directly.
