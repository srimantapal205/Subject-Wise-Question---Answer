# The Microsoft Fabric

### **Microsoft Fabric – Introduction**

Microsoft Fabric is an **end-to-end unified analytics platform** that brings together data engineering, data integration, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence (BI) — all under one SaaS (Software as a Service) umbrella.
It’s built on top of **OneLake**, a single, unified data lake that enables seamless data sharing and governance across multiple domains.

Fabric simplifies complex data architectures by combining capabilities from Power BI, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Data Factory into one integrated experience.
With Fabric, organizations can manage their entire data lifecycle — from ingestion to transformation, storage, analysis, and visualization — using a single environment.
