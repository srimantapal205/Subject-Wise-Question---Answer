# üõ°Ô∏è **Governance and Security in Microsoft Fabric**

---

## üß≠ **Introduction**

**Governance and Security** in Microsoft Fabric ensures that your data is:

* **Secure**: Only authorized users can access data.
* **Auditable**: All actions are tracked for compliance.
* **Well-documented**: Data lineage and cataloging make it easier to understand data flow and usage.

Fabric provides **role-based access control (RBAC), data lineage, cataloging, and auditing** capabilities integrated across all Fabric components:

* Lakehouse
* Data Warehouse
* KQL Databases
* Power BI dashboards
* Pipelines and Notebooks

The goal is to balance **accessibility for analysis** with **enterprise-grade security and compliance**.

## üîπ **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

RBAC allows organizations to **define roles** and **permissions** for users and groups, controlling access to **workspaces, datasets, tables, dashboards, and pipelines**.

### **Key Components**

| Component              | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Users / Groups**     | Individuals or Active Directory groups in Microsoft Entra ID                   |
| **Roles**              | Define access level: Admin, Contributor, Viewer, Data Engineer, Data Scientist |
| **Permissions**        | Read, write, execute, or manage access on specific objects                     |
| **Workspaces / Items** | RBAC is applied at workspace, lakehouse, Delta table, or dashboard level       |

---

### **RBAC Example**

**Scenario:** A company has multiple teams:

1. **Admin**: Full access to all Lakehouses and dashboards
2. **Data Engineers**: Can create pipelines and Delta tables but cannot view dashboards
3. **Data Scientists**: Can run notebooks, read/write to Delta tables, and access training datasets
4. **Business Users**: View dashboards and reports only

**Configuration Example**

* Lakehouse `SalesLakehouse`:

  * Admin: Full permissions
  * Data Scientist: Read/Write tables
  * Business User: Read-only access to curated tables

---

               ‚îú‚îÄ Data Engineer (Edit/Run)
               ‚îî‚îÄ Data Scientist (Run)
```

## üîπ **2. Data Lineage and Cataloging**

**Data Lineage** shows how data flows through Fabric, from ingestion to consumption. This helps in:

* Impact analysis (e.g., ‚ÄúWhich dashboards are affected if table changes?‚Äù)
* Debugging and tracing errors
* Understanding dependencies across workspaces, pipelines, and dashboards

**Data Cataloging** helps organize and document datasets and items:

* Tag datasets with **business metadata** (owner, sensitivity, description)
* Enable **searchable catalogs** for self-service analytics
* Integrate with compliance and auditing systems

---

### **Example: Lineage Visualization**

**Scenario:** Sales data processing

1. Raw CSV ingested into **SalesLakehouse**
2. Delta table `SalesData` created
3. ETL pipeline aggregates data into `SalesSummary` table
4. Power BI dashboard `Monthly Sales` consumes `SalesSummary`

**Lineage Diagram:**

```
[Raw CSV Files] --> [Lakehouse: SalesData (Delta)]
         ‚îÇ
         ‚ñº
[ETL Pipeline: Aggregate] --> [Delta Table: SalesSummary]
         ‚îÇ
         ‚ñº
[Power BI Dashboard: Monthly Sales]
```

* Changes in `SalesData` can be traced to see which dashboards are impacted.

---

## üîπ **3. Compliance and Auditing**

Fabric provides **audit trails and compliance features** for enterprise governance:

### **Auditing**

* Tracks **who accessed or modified data**
* Monitors pipeline runs, notebook executions, and dashboard views
* Generates logs for security audits

### **Compliance**

* Integration with **Microsoft Purview** for data governance
* Supports **data classification**, **sensitivity labels**, and **regulatory compliance** (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
* Ensures **data residency and encryption standards** are met

---

### **Example: Auditing and Compliance**

1. User `John` runs a notebook that updates `SalesData`.

2. Fabric audit logs record:

   * Timestamp: `2025-10-08 10:00:00`
   * User: John
   * Action: Update Delta Table `SalesData`
   * Location: Lakehouse `SalesLakehouse`

3. Compliance team can review:

   * Who modified sensitive data
   * When the changes occurred
   * What dashboards or reports might be affected

## üîπ **4. Practical Example**

**Scenario:** A retail company wants to ensure only authorized personnel can access **Sales Data**, track all changes, and comply with GDPR.

1. **RBAC**:

   * Admins: Full access
   * Data Engineers: Edit pipelines
   * Business Users: Read-only access to reports
2. **Lineage & Cataloging**:

   * Track data from raw CSV ‚Üí Delta tables ‚Üí Power BI dashboards
   * Tag datasets as **‚ÄúSensitive / Personal Data‚Äù**
3. **Auditing**:

   * Monitor who modified or viewed sensitive data
   * Review logs for GDPR compliance
4. **Action**: Alerts if unauthorized access occurs, or data changes unexpectedly

**Q3.** What is data lineage and why is it important?
**A3.** Data lineage tracks the flow of data from source to consumption, helping in impact analysis, debugging, and regulatory compliance.

**Q4.** How does cataloging improve governance?
**A4.** By adding metadata, sensitivity labels, and ownership, making datasets easier to discover, understand, and manage.

**Q5.** Name two things audit logs can track in Fabric.
**A5.** User activity (who accessed/modified data) and pipeline/notebook execution history.

**Q6.** How can Fabric help with regulatory compliance like GDPR?
**A6.** Through auditing, sensitivity labels, data cataloging, and integration with Microsoft Purview for governance.

**Q7.** Can RBAC be applied to Power BI dashboards?
**A7.** Yes, RBAC controls access to dashboards and the underlying datasets.

**Q8.** What is the difference between data lineage and auditing?
**A8.** Data lineage shows how data flows and dependencies; auditing logs record user actions and changes for compliance.
