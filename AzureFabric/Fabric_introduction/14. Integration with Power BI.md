# **14. Integration with Power BI in Microsoft Fabric**

Power BI is a **first-class citizen** within Microsoft Fabric. Fabric unifies data engineering, data science, real-time analytics, and Power BI under **OneLake**, so reporting users can consume data **without data movement**.

---

## 🟦 **1. Direct Lake Mode**

Direct Lake mode is a **revolutionary storage/compute mode** introduced with Fabric. It combines the best of **Import mode** and **DirectQuery**.

| Mode            | Storage               | Performance              | Refresh Required      |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Import          | In-memory             | Very fast                | Yes                   |
| DirectQuery     | Remote DB             | Slower (network latency) | No                    |
| **Direct Lake** | OneLake / Delta files | As fast as Import        | **No refresh needed** |

### ✔ Why Direct Lake?

* Power BI reads **Parquet/Delta tables directly from OneLake**
* Avoids ETL or dataset refresh
* Changes in data become **immediately available to Power BI**
* Eliminates the complexity of data duplication & scheduled refreshes

### Requirements

* Lakehouse tables must be **Delta format**
* Data model must use **star schema / optimized table structure**
* Dataset must be **in Direct Lake mode from Fabric Warehouse/Lakehouse**

### When to use Direct Lake?

* Large analytics datasets
* Near real-time dashboards
* Unified analytics (no duplication between storage and BI)

## 🟦 **2. Connecting Power BI to Lakehouses and Warehouses**

In Fabric, you can connect to **Lakehouses** and **Warehouses** in multiple ways.

### 🔹 When connecting to a **Lakehouse**

| Method           | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct Lake      | Power BI reads Delta tables directly from OneLake |
| Import           | Data is loaded into Power BI model                |
| OneLake Shortcut | Access external lakehouse data without copy       |
| SQL Endpoint     | Query via Lakehouse SQL endpoint                  |

### 🔹 When connecting to a **SQL Warehouse**

| Method      | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| DirectQuery | Real-time querying                          |
| Import      | Fast performance after loading data         |
| Dual Mode   | Combines Import + DirectQuery intelligently |

### Integration Flow Example

```
Raw files → Lakehouse bronze → Lakehouse silver/gold → semantic model → Power BI Reports
```

### Best Practices

✔ Use **gold layer tables** (cleaned, curated) for reporting
✔ Build **dimensional star schema** for performance
✔ Use **Direct Lake mode** where possible for refresh-free reporting

## 🟦 **3. Building Semantic Models & Reports**

In Fabric, **semantic models (Power BI datasets)** are centrally stored and governed as a Fabric item.

### What is a Semantic Model?

A semantic model is a **business-friendly layer** built on top of warehouse or lakehouse tables for analytics.

### Semantic Model Components

| Component          | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Tables             | Dimensions & facts imported/direct lake |
| Relationships      | Define business logic across tables     |
| DAX measures       | KPIs, aggregations, calculations        |
| Row-Level Security | User-based access to data               |

### Creating a Semantic Model in Fabric

| Step | Action                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Select tables from Lakehouse / Warehouse |
| 2    | Model star schema – relationships & keys |
| 3    | Create DAX measures & hierarchies        |
| 4    | Save semantic model                      |
| 5    | Build reports on top of it               |

### Reporting in Power BI

✔ Build visuals using the semantic model
✔ Schedule refresh only if Import mode is used
✔ Publish to workspace & share dashboards

### Benefits of Semantic Models in Fabric

* Reusable business logic across reports
* Can be secured via workspace roles & RLS
* Governed and monitored just like other Fabric items

# 🧠 **Practice Questions & Answers**

---

### **Q1: What is the main advantage of Direct Lake mode over Import and DirectQuery?**

**A:** Direct Lake combines high performance (similar to Import) with real-time access (similar to DirectQuery) without dataset refreshes, because it reads Delta/Parquet tables directly from OneLake.

---

### **Q2: Can we build Power BI reports directly from a Lakehouse? How?**

**A:** Yes. Options are:

* Direct Lake mode (recommended)
* Import mode
* SQL endpoint
* OneLake shortcut with Direct Lake

---

### **Q3: What is required for Direct Lake mode to work?**

* Lakehouse tables must be **Delta format**
* Star/Snowflake schema recommended
* Semantic model must be based on **Warehouse or Lakehouse tables**

---

### **Q4: What is the difference between Lakehouse and SQL Warehouse for Power BI reporting?**

| Lakehouse                       | Warehouse                           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Ideal for large-scale analytics | More structured & SQL optimized     |
| Direct Lake mode                | DirectQuery + Import                |
| Lightweight compute             | Heavy compute with high concurrency |

---

### **Q5: Why do we need semantic models in Fabric?**

**A:** To create a reusable, governed business layer for analytics—containing measures, relationships, hierarchies, and security—used by multiple Power BI reports.

---

### **Q6: What is Dual Mode in Power BI?**

Dual Mode combines **Import + DirectQuery**. Frequently used data stays cached; real-time values are queried on demand.

---

### **Q7: Can Power BI support Real-Time Dashboards in Fabric?**

Yes. Using:

* Direct Lake mode
* DirectQuery on Warehouse
* Real-Time Analytics KQL Databases if streaming data is involved

---

### **Q8: What advantages does building Power BI inside Fabric offer?**

* Zero ETL between analytics & reporting
* Unified governance and security
* No need for manually scheduled refreshes (Direct Lake)
* Better cost and performance efficiency
