# ⚡ **Data Activator in Microsoft Fabric**

---

## 🧭 **Introduction**

**Data Activator** is a **real-time, event-driven automation tool** in Microsoft Fabric. It allows organizations to **monitor data and trigger actions automatically** based on **specific conditions or events**.

**Key objectives:**

* Enable **proactive decision-making**
* Automate responses to **data changes or anomalies**
* Integrate seamlessly with **Power BI, Lakehouses, Data Warehouse, and other Fabric items**

It is especially useful for:

* Alerting on KPIs exceeding thresholds
* Automating business workflows
* Monitoring streaming data in real time

---

## 🔹 **1. Overview and Purpose**

Data Activator allows you to define **rules** that monitor **live data** or **data changes** and trigger actions such as:

* Sending notifications (email, Teams)
* Updating dashboards or datasets
* Invoking pipelines or APIs
* Triggering machine learning scoring jobs

**Why use Data Activator?**

* Minimize latency between insight and action
* Reduce manual monitoring
* Ensure consistent operational response
* Fully integrated with the Microsoft Fabric ecosystem

## 🔹 **2. Trigger-Based Automation**

Data Activator works on **event triggers** or **condition-based triggers**:

### **Trigger Types**

| Trigger Type               | Description                                                   | Example                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Data change**            | Fires when new data arrives or updates in Lakehouse/Warehouse | A new sales record exceeds $10,000    |
| **Threshold / KPI**        | Fires when a measure crosses a specified threshold            | Daily revenue drops below target      |
| **Scheduled / Time-based** | Fires on a defined schedule                                   | Run ML scoring nightly at 2 AM        |
| **External events**        | Fires based on external API or webhooks                       | IoT sensor detects temperature > 80°C |

---

### **Rule Example**

**Scenario:** Alert the operations team if any machine temperature exceeds 80°C.

**Steps:**

1. **Data source:** `TemperatureData` KQL table (streaming IoT data)
2. **Condition:** `Temperature > 80`
3. **Action:** Send Teams/Email alert and trigger a maintenance pipeline

**Pseudo-visual workflow:**

```
[TemperatureData Table] 
       │
       ▼
[Data Activator Rule: Temperature > 80]
       │
       ├─ Send Teams alert
       └─ Trigger Fabric pipeline (Maintenance workflow)
```

## 🔹 **3. Integrations with Fabric Items**

Data Activator integrates seamlessly with multiple Fabric services:

| Fabric Item                  | Integration Use Case                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Power BI**                 | Trigger alerts when a KPI tile or measure crosses a threshold; refresh dashboards automatically |
| **Lakehouse / Delta Tables** | Monitor new data or updates for anomalies; trigger downstream pipelines                         |
| **Data Warehouse**           | Trigger notifications or actions based on aggregated metrics or query results                   |
| **Pipelines / Data Factory** | Automate ETL or scoring workflows                                                               |
| **Notebooks / ML models**    | Trigger retraining or scoring based on new or anomalous data                                    |

### **Example Scenario**

**Use Case:** Retail sales monitoring

1. **Data source:** Sales data in Lakehouse (Delta table)
2. **Trigger:** Daily sales < $5000 for any store
3. **Action:**

   * Send Power BI alert to management
   * Run a Fabric pipeline to analyze causes and send report

**Workflow Diagram:**

```
[Lakehouse: Daily Sales Table]
          │
          ▼
[Data Activator: Daily Sales < $5000]
          │
   ┌─────────────┐
   │             │
[Send Email]  [Run Analysis Pipeline]
          │             │
          ▼             ▼
   [Management]    [Automated Report]
```

### **Step-by-Step Configuration in Fabric**

1. Open **Data Activator** in your Fabric workspace.
2. Click **New Rule**.
3. Select **Data Source** (Delta table, KQL DB, Power BI dataset).
4. Define **Trigger Condition** (threshold, anomaly, new row).
5. Define **Action** (Email, Teams, run pipeline, ML scoring).
6. Activate the rule — Data Activator continuously monitors and triggers actions in real time.
