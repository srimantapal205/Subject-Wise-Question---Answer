# 🧠 **Practice Questions & Answers (Interview-Focused)**

---

### **Q1: Describe an end-to-end data pipeline in Microsoft Fabric.**

**A:**
In Fabric, an end-to-end pipeline includes ingestion (ADF pipelines), raw storage in Lakehouse bronze, transformation via notebooks/dataflows into silver/gold layers, loading curated tables into Warehouse, building semantic models, reporting using Power BI Direct Lake, and running ML models for predictions — all orchestrated using pipeline triggers.

---

### **Q2: Why is the Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture important in Fabric?**

* Bronze → Raw ingestion, no business rules
* Silver → Standardized/validated/cleansed data
* Gold → Analytics-optimized dimensional models
  This layered approach ensures governance, reliability, and performance.

---

### **Q3: When should a Data Warehouse be used in addition to a Lakehouse?**

Use a Warehouse when:

* You need **high concurrency SQL analytics**
* You need **snapshot / SCD modeling**
* Business analysts need **T-SQL-first experience**

---

### **Q4: How does Fabric simplify predictive analytics compared to traditional platforms?**

* Data stays in OneLake → No ETL required to ML systems
* Notebooks & ML runtime integrated
* Predictions can be sent directly to gold tables → Available instantly in Power BI

---

### **Q5: Where do Power BI dashboards get prediction results?**

From:

* Lakehouse gold tables
* Data Warehouse tables
* Semantic model measures using predicted outputs

---

### **Q6: How can AI be operationalized in a real-time solution?**

Deploy ML as API → Trigger scoring via KQL DB streaming → Send predictions to Lakehouse/Power BI dashboards.
