# Apache Spark, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)


In **Apache Spark**, a **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** is a fundamental concept that represents the **execution plan** for a set of computations. It plays a critical role in how Spark performs optimizations and schedules tasks efficiently.

### ðŸ”¹ What is a DAG in Spark?

* A **DAG** is a **graph** where:

  * **Nodes** represent **RDD transformations** (like `map`, `filter`, etc.).
  * **Edges** represent the **data flow** between those transformations.
* It is **directed** (operations flow in one direction) and **acyclic** (no loops).

---

### ðŸ”¹ How DAG is formed?

When you write Spark code:

1. **Transformations** (like `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`) are lazy â€” they donâ€™t compute results immediately.
2. When an **action** (like `collect()`, `count()`, `saveAsTextFile()`) is called, Spark:

   * Triggers execution.
   * Builds a **DAG of stages** based on the transformations.
   * Optimizes the DAG into a series of **stages** (sets of parallel tasks).
   * Schedules and executes these tasks across the cluster.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Example

```python
rdd = sc.textFile("data.txt")
words = rdd.flatMap(lambda line: line.split())
pairs = words.map(lambda word: (word, 1))
counts = pairs.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b)
counts.saveAsTextFile("output")
```

* This creates a DAG with:

  * `textFile` â†’ `flatMap` â†’ `map` â†’ `reduceByKey` â†’ `saveAsTextFile`
* Spark will break this into **stages** depending on **shuffles** (like `reduceByKey` triggers a shuffle).

### ðŸ”¹ DAG vs Stages vs Tasks

| Concept   | Description                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DAG**   | Logical execution plan of transformations.                                  |
| **Stage** | A group of transformations that can be executed together without a shuffle. |
| **Task**  | A unit of work sent to an executor (e.g., processing a partition).          |

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits of DAG in Spark

* **Optimization**: Spark can analyze the entire DAG and optimize the execution.
* **Fault Tolerance**: If a task fails, Spark can recompute it using the DAG lineage.
* **Lazy Evaluation**: Transformations are not run until an action is called, giving Spark a chance to optimize.
