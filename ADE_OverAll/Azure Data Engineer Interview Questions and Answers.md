Azure Blob Storage is more general-purpose and used for storing unstructured data. Data Lake Storage Gen2 builds on top of Blob Storage but includes enhancements for big data workloads.

### 4. What is the purpose of the Integration Runtime in Azure Data Factory?

**Answer**: Integration Runtime (IR) in Azure Data Factory acts as a bridge between the activity and the data store. It supports data movement, dispatch, and integration capabilities across different network environments, including Azure, on-premises, and hybrid scenarios. There are three types: Azure IR, Self-hosted IR, and Azure-SSIS IR.

### 5. Explain the concept of a Data Lake and its importance.

**Answer**: A Data Lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. Its importance lies in its ability to ingest data in its raw form from various sources, providing a foundation for advanced analytics and machine learning. It allows for schema-on-read, meaning data is interpreted at the time of processing, offering flexibility and scalability.

### 6. How would you optimize the performance of an Azure Data Factory pipeline?

**Answer**: Optimizing performance in ADF pipelines can be achieved by:
