## Section 1: Azure Databricks & Data Engineering

### 1. What is your approach to designing scalable and efficient data pipelines in Azure Databricks?

**Answer:** Designing scalable and efficient data pipelines in Azure Databricks requires careful consideration of data volume, processing patterns, architecture, and optimization techniques

1. Understand Requirements and Data Characteristics.
    * Data sources: Streaming or batch? Structured, semi-structured (JSON/CSV), or unstructured (images)?
    * Volume & Velocity: How much data? How fast does it arrive?
    * Latency requirements: Real-time vs near-real-time vs batch.
    *Data quality: Validate completeness, consistency, and schema.
2. Choose the Right Architecture
    * Batch processing: Use Databricks jobs with Delta Lake for historical loads.
    * Streaming processing: Use Structured Streaming with Event Hub/Kafka as sources.
    * Lambda/Kappa architectures: Depending on need for unified vs separate streaming/batch layers
3. Use Delta Lake as the Foundation
    * Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, schema enforcement, time travel, and scalable metadata handling.
    * Partitioning
    * Z-Ordering (for efficient reads)
    * OPTIMIZE and VACUUM commands
4. Optimize Spark Performance
    * Cluster Sizing: Right-size based on workload – use autoscaling for flexibility.
    * Caching: Use .cache() or .persist() wisely for intermediate transformations.
    * Broadcast joins: For small lookup datasets, reduce shuffle by broadcasting.
    * Avoid wide transformations: Use narrow transformations where possible.
    * Data Skew: Monitor skewed keys and use techniques like salting or custom partitioning.
5. Modular and Parameterized Notebooks/Jobs
    * Ingestion
    * Transformation
    * Validation
    * Load
    * Use widgets or job parameters to make notebooks reusable and testable.
6. Monitoring and Logging
    * Integrate with Azure Monitor and Databricks' Ganglia metrics.
    * Use log4j or MLflow for custom logging/metrics.
    * Track input/output record counts, job duration, error rates, etc.
7. Security and Compliance
    * Use Unity Catalog or legacy Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    * Enforce row-level and column-level access where needed.
    * Encrypt data at rest and in transit using Azure Key Vault.
8. Automation & CI/CD
    * Use Databricks Repos with Git for version control.
    * Deploy using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or Terraform (Databricks Provider).
    * Parameterize jobs via Job API 2.1 or dbutils.widgets.
9. Scheduling & Orchestration
    * Use Databricks Workflows for job orchestration.
    * Or use Azure Data Factory/Azure Synapse Pipelines to schedule and monitor external dependencies.
10. Scalability Considerations
    * Use Auto Loader for incremental ingestion of files.
    * Use multicluster jobs for concurrent processing.
    * Implement idempotent operations to avoid duplicate writes (especially in streaming).
