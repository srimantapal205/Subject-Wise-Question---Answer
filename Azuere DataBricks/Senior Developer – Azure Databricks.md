# Azure Databricks & Data Engineering

## 1. What is your approach to designing scalable and efficient data pipelines in Azure Databricks?

**Answer:** Designing scalable and efficient data pipelines in Azure Databricks requires careful consideration of data volume, processing patterns, architecture, and optimization techniques

1. Understand Requirements and Data Characteristics.
    * Data sources: Streaming or batch? Structured, semi-structured (JSON/CSV), or unstructured (images)?
    * Volume & Velocity: How much data? How fast does it arrive?
    * Latency requirements: Real-time vs near-real-time vs batch.
    *Data quality: Validate completeness, consistency, and schema.

2. Choose the Right Architecture
    * Batch processing: Use Databricks jobs with Delta Lake for historical loads.
    * Streaming processing: Use Structured Streaming with Event Hub/Kafka as sources.
    * Lambda/Kappa architectures: Depending on need for unified vs separate streaming/batch layers

3. Use Delta Lake as the Foundation
    * Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, schema enforcement, time travel, and scalable metadata handling.
    * Partitioning
    * Z-Ordering (for efficient reads)
    * OPTIMIZE and VACUUM commands

4. Optimize Spark Performance
    * Cluster Sizing: Right-size based on workload – use autoscaling for flexibility.
    * Caching: Use .cache() or .persist() wisely for intermediate transformations.
    * Broadcast joins: For small lookup datasets, reduce shuffle by broadcasting.
    * Avoid wide transformations: Use narrow transformations where possible.
    * Data Skew: Monitor skewed keys and use techniques like salting or custom partitioning.

5. Modular and Parameterized Notebooks/Jobs
    * Ingestion
    * Transformation
    * Validation
    * Load
    * Use widgets or job parameters to make notebooks reusable and testable.

6. Monitoring and Logging
    * Integrate with Azure Monitor and Databricks' Ganglia metrics.
    * Use log4j or MLflow for custom logging/metrics.
    * Track input/output record counts, job duration, error rates, etc.

7. Security and Compliance
    * Use Unity Catalog or legacy Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    * Enforce row-level and column-level access where needed.
    * Encrypt data at rest and in transit using Azure Key Vault.

8. Automation & CI/CD
    * Use Databricks Repos with Git for version control.
    * Deploy using Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or Terraform (Databricks Provider).
    * Parameterize jobs via Job API 2.1 or dbutils.widgets.

9. Scheduling & Orchestration
    * Use Databricks Workflows for job orchestration.
    * Or use Azure Data Factory/Azure Synapse Pipelines to schedule and monitor external dependencies.
    
10. Scalability Considerations
    * Use Auto Loader for incremental ingestion of files.
    * Use multicluster jobs for concurrent processing.
    * Implement idempotent operations to avoid duplicate writes (especially in streaming).


## 2. How would you handle ingestion from multiple structured and unstructured data sources into Databricks?

**Answer:** Ingesting data from multiple **structured and unstructured** data sources into **Azure Databricks** involves a combination of tools and techniques to ensure scalability, flexibility, and reliability. Here's a structured approach to handling such ingestion:


###  1. **Understand the Source Systems**

**Structured Sources:**

* **Relational databases** (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* **Cloud databases** (Azure SQL DB, Azure Synapse, Snowflake)

**Unstructured Sources:**

* **File-based** (JSON, XML, CSV, Parquet, Avro, etc.)
* **Media** (images, videos, PDFs, logs)
* **Streaming sources** (Event Hub, Kafka, IoT Hub)


###  2. **Design the Ingestion Architecture**

Use the **Medallion Architecture**:

* **Bronze**: Raw ingestion
* **Silver**: Cleaned and transformed
* **Gold**: Business-ready data


###  3. **Tools and Technologies**

| Scenario            | Recommended Tools                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch ingestion     | **Auto Loader**, Azure Data Factory                                 |
| Streaming ingestion | **Structured Streaming**, Kafka, Event Hubs                         |
| File ingestion      | **Auto Loader**, DBFS, ABFS (ADLS Gen2)                             |
| API ingestion       | **Databricks notebooks (Python, Scala)** using `requests` or `http` |
| Database ingestion  | **JDBC connectors**, ADF, `spark.read.jdbc()`                       |



###  4. **Ingestion Patterns**

####  **Using Auto Loader** (for files on ADLS/S3/Blob)

```python
df = (
  spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles")
  .option("cloudFiles.format", "json")  # or csv/parquet
  .option("cloudFiles.schemaLocation", "/mnt/schema")
  .load("/mnt/input-data")
)
```

####  **Using JDBC for RDBMS ingestion**

```python
jdbc_url = "jdbc:sqlserver://<server>;database=<db>"
df = spark.read.format("jdbc").option("url", jdbc_url) \
    .option("dbtable", "dbo.table_name") \
    .option("user", "<user>").option("password", "<password>").load()
```

####  **Using Structured Streaming for Event Hub**

```python
df = spark.readStream.format("eventhubs").options(**event_hub_config).load()
```

####  **Using Azure Data Factory**

* Use ADF pipelines to ingest from APIs, FTP, RDBMS to ADLS.
* Databricks reads from the staging location (Bronze layer).


###  5. **Handling Schema and File Variability**

* Use **Auto Loader's schema evolution** capabilities.
* Use `mergeSchema` when reading Parquet/Avro.
* Use `multiline` and `schema inference` with JSON/XML.


###  6. **Incremental and Change Data Capture (CDC)**

* For RDBMS: Use **watermark column** or **Change Tracking**.
* In Delta Lake: Use **merge**, **upsert**, and **Z-Ordering** for optimized queries.


###  7. **Optimization and Best Practices**

* Use **Delta Lake** for all intermediate and final storage.
* Use **checkpointing** for streaming jobs.
* Use **partitioning** and **Z-Ordering** for performance.
* Manage schema evolution and versioning carefully.


###  8. **Monitoring and Alerting**

* Use **Databricks jobs**, **notebook logs**, and **structured streaming sinks**.
* Integrate with **Azure Monitor**, **Log Analytics**, or **custom dashboards**.


###  Example Workflow

1. **Structured data from SQL Server**: Ingest via ADF → ADLS → Databricks → Delta table
2. **Unstructured JSON logs**: Auto Loader → Bronze table → parse and cleanse → Silver table
3. **IoT streaming data**: Event Hub → Databricks Structured Streaming → Delta Lake
